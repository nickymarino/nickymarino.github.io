Hi! I'm Nicky Marino. This site is dedicated to my thoughts on software development. You can contact me via [email](mailto:{{ site.author.email }}), on [GitHub]({{ site.author.github }}), or on [LinkedIn]({{ site.author.linkedin }}).

I'm an AI Engineer at [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com) enabling enterprise businesses to deploy, monitor, and govern machine learning models at scale.

In my free time, I like to lift heavy things, [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71810120-nicky), [play](https://dodgeroll.com/gungeon/) [rogue-lites](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/), and learn new technologies.

I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), typeset in [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
