[Replit](https://repl.it) is a free, collaborative, in-browser IDE for creating new projects without setting up any environments on your computer. With Replit, you don't need to "deploy" your projects to any service; they'll be instantly available to you as soon as you start typing. In this post, we'll review how to create a Flask app, set up folders for HTML and CSS templates, and learn how to navigate your Flask app.

Before following these steps, you must first create an account on [replit](replit.com).

# Creating a Flask Project

First, let's create a blank Python project. On your [replit](replit.com) homepage, create new project by clicking “Python" under the "Create" heading:

![Replit homepage with the "Python" button highlighted]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(9).png' %}){: .center}

For the project name, type `my-first-flask-site` and click "Create repl”:

![Example showing creating a new Python repl]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image.jpeg' %}){: .center}

Your new project will automatically create a file named `main.py` and open a Python IDE for you, but we need to install Flask before we can start writing our app. On the left sidebar, click the "Packages" icon, which looks like a hexagonal box:

![Repl editor with the "Packages" icon highlighted]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(8).png' %}){: .center}

From here, we can install any Python packages that you want to import in your app. Install the Flask package by typing “flask” and selecting the first item from the list named "Flask":

![Repl editor with the "Flask" item highlighted]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(7).png' %}){: .center}

Then, click the “Files” icon on the left sidebar to go back to the files list. You should see `main.py`, which was already created for you.

# Hello, World!

Our first Flask app will have one page—the index page—that says `Hello World!` when we go to the home page. Copy the below code into the file named `main.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

# Create a flask app
app = Flask(
  __name__,
  template_folder='templates',
  static_folder='static'
)

# Index page
@app.route('/')
def hello():
  return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Run the Flask app
  app.run(
	host='0.0.0.0',
	debug=True,
	port=8080
  )
```

In this code, we have one page that’s controlled by the `hello()` function. It's route is `’/‘`, which means that it is at the home page of our app.

For flask projects, Replit looks for a web server at the local URL `http://0.0.0.0:8080`, so we need set the `host` to `’0.0.0.0'` and the `port` to `8080` in `app.run(…)`. We also set `debug=True` so that any changes you make to files will be automatically updated when you refresh a page.

We’ll use `render_template`, `template_folder`, and `static_folder` later in this tutorial, so don't worry about those just yet.

Now, click the green “Run” button at the top of the page. Replit should install Flask, then open a browser with your first Flask app!

![Repl editor showing the Flask app running]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(6).png' %}){: .center}

The bottom right window is the Python console, and will show any error messages or logs that are printed.

At any time, you can click the “Stop” button at the top and click “Run” again to restart your Flask app.

Sometimes, your app might have multiple pages. To go to a different URL (or `@app.route`) in your app, click the icon “Open in a new tab" on the browser window. It will be to the right of the address bar:

![Repl editor with the "Open in a new tab" button highlighted]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(5).png' %}){: .center}

You can type in a new path in the address bar of the new tab, such as [`https://my-first-flask-site.YOUR_USERNAME.repl.co/my-second-page`](https://my-first-flask-site.songsblade.repl.co/my-second-page). Right now, your server will return a 404 for that page because it doesn't exist.

# HTML Assets and CSS Styles

Next, let’s add an HTML file and a CSS file to our Flask app. HTML files are commonly put in a `templates` folder in a Flask project, because they are usually templates to show information. Our Flask code will supply values to HTML templates via variables, so that our app can change via Python code.

## Adding an Index Page

In `main.py`, we already set up our Flask app to look in the `templates` folder for HTML files:

```python
# Create a flask app
app = Flask(
  # ...
  template_folder='templates',
  # ...
)
```

Now let’s create the `templates` folder and create an `index.html` file. Next to the “Files" header on the top left, click the "Add folder" button and name the new folder `templates`. Then, click the three dot icon on the `templates` folder and click "Add file". Name the new file `index.html`. To have both `index.html` and `main.py` open at the same time in your editor, right click `main.py` on the files list and click "Open tab".

Your editor should now look like this (note that there’s two tabs in the editor now: one for `templates/index.html` and one for `main.py`):

![Repl editor with the index and main tabs both open]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(4).png' %}){: .center}

Copy the below code into the `templates/index.html` file:

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
	<title>My First Flask Website</title>
	<link href="/static/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
	<p>
		Welcome to your first Flask website
	</p>
</body>
```

And replace your contents in `main.py` with the below code. This new version updates the `hello()` function to `index()`, and it returns the contents of `index.html` to the user:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

# Create a flask app
app = Flask(
  __name__,
  template_folder='templates',
  static_folder='static'
)

# Index page (now using the index.html file)
@app.route('/')
def index():
  return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
  # Run the Flask app
  app.run(
	host='0.0.0.0',
	debug=True,
	port=8080
  )
```

Click the Refresh button in the browser window of the project (**not** the refresh button in Chrome or Firefox, but the refresh button for the smaller window in your project), and you should see the contents of your index page with a large header:

![Repl editor showing the web app's new large header]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(3).png' %}){: .center}

## Adding CSS Styling

Now let’s add a CSS file to change the color of the text of our app. The Flask app is set up to look inside a `static` folder for CSS and JS assets:

```python
# Create a flask app
app = Flask(
  # ...
  static_folder='static'
)
```

And the index page is set up to look for a file named `style.css` inside the `static` folder:

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
	<!-- ... -->
	<link href="/static/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
	<!-- ... -->
```

Click `main.py` on the Files list, then click the “Add a folder” icon to the left of the “Files” header. Name the new folder `static`. Next, click the three dot icon next to your new `static` folder and click "Add file". Name the file `style.css`, and open it by right clicking the file and selecting “Open in tab".

Your project should now look like this:

![Repl editor showing current state of the project]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image%20(2).png' %}){: .center}

Let’s write some CSS to change the color of the “Welcome” message to red. Add the following code to your `static/style.css` file:

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

Click the Refresh button in the project browser window (**not** the refresh button in Chrome or Firefox, but the refresh button for the smaller window in your project), and the “Welcome" screen will turn red:

![Repl editor showing the web app's new red text]({% include _functions/image_path.html name='Image.png' %}){: .center}

Congratulations, you’ve written your very first Flask app!
