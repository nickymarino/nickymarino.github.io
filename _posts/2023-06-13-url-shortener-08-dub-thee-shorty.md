So far, I've been referring to this project as just `URL Shortener`, which doesn't do it justice. If I'm creating the Next Web Scale Startupâ„¢, I need a cool and flashy name for this project.

I spent a few hours poking at possible domain names in [AWS Route 53][r53], but it was tough to use. Every search would take a few seconds, none of my ideas were able to be purchased, and Route 53 even started recommending me domains that I had *already searched for* that were previously listed as unavailable.

I realized that since my plan is to host on `link.nickymarino.com` eventually, I don't need a custom domain. I can just use Route 53 as the [DNS service for the subdomain][dns] and [import the custom domain in SST][sst-custom] without worrying about migrating the parent domain `nickymarino.com` away from Hover[^1].

[^1]: [Hover][hover] is fantastic, by the way! I've used them for years and years now, and I've had a great experience.

So! Unconstrained by the fickle beast of whatever domains are up for grabs and don't cost $300/month, [without further ado][game-changer], we'll be doing business here as `shorty`.

Updating the code with the new name is pretty trivial. We'll change the name formally in `package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "shorty",
  // ...
```

As well as in `sst.config.ts`:

```ts
export default {
  config(_input) {
    return {
      name: "shorty",
      region: "us-east-1",
    };
  },
  stacks(app) {
    app.stack(Database);
    app.stack(API);
    app.stack(Site);
  },
} satisfies SSTConfig;
```

And then we'll need to update each of the sub-module `package.json` files, such as in `packages/core/package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "@shorty/core",
  // ...
```

Each import statement needs to be updated too, such as in `packages/functions/src/redirect.ts`:

```ts
import { Link } from "@shorty/core/link";

// ...
```

This was super straightforward using VSCode's [project-wide find and replace][replace]. However, because the name of the app changed, SST deploys my stack as `test-shorty` (in `STAGE-APPNAME` format) instead of `test-cow-link`[^2]. To sanity check, let's re-populate the DB with some links and load the UI to make sure it's all connected:

[^2]: And I had to manually delete each of the stacks for the old deploy. Grumble grumble.

And it works! You can view the code on the [**Rename project to shorty**][pr-13] PR.
